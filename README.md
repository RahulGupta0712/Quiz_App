Quiz Android App is made for users to test their knowledge on various aspects like History, Politics, Entertainment, etc.  
  
A User will have 10 random questions from a dataset of 548 questions and each question will have 30 seconds to answer.  
  
I have used Firebase Realtime Database in this application, so the app would require Internet to play the quiz.  
  
User will get to know the correct answer after locking in the answer for each question. Thus, enhancing user's knowledge.  
  
I have also used Fragments and Animations to enhance user experience.
